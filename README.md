# Analyzing Time Series at Scale with Cluster Analysis in R

WIP...

Materials for the [Analyzing Time Series at Scale with Cluster Analysis in R](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine#h.9rof53i542dh) workshop for Ukraine.

**When ðŸ“†:** Thursday, October 17th, 18:00 - 20:00 CEST 

**Description:** One of the challenges in traditional time series analysis is scalability. Most of the analysis methods were designed to handle a single time series at a time. In this workshop, we will explore methods for analyzing time series at scale. We will demonstrate how to apply unsupervised methods such as cluster analysis and PCA to analyze and extract insights from multiple time series simultaneously. This workshop is based on Prof. Rob J Hyndman's paper about feature-based time series analysis.
